# 3D_Finger_geometry_Java

A Biometric Authentication System based on measurements of the userâ€™s three-dimensional (3-D) hand geometry is proposed. The system relies on
a novel real-time and low-cost 3-D sensor that generates a dense-range image of the scene. I worked on the 3-D feature measurement parts that
describe and test on an image database simulating a variety of working conditions.
